Use Binary search for papers that have been sorted by Bibliographic, Paper Title, and Serial Title because the collection has a defined order and unique entries. 
Use linear search for papers that have been sorted by author name, and chronological because although they have a defined order, there may be multiple papers with the same authors, or date and binary search can only find one entry.
Use linear search for papers that have been sorted randomly because they do not have a defined order.

6. [?] Use the sort() and binarySearch() methods from the Collections class to sort and search for data
